Cog model that outputs CLIP features for text and images.

Run with the API:

```
import replicate
import numpy as np
from numpy.linalg import norm

def cos_sim(a, b):
    return np.dot(a, b) / (norm(a) * norm(b))

inputs = """
a photo of a dog
a cat
two cats with remote controls

"""

# run prediction
model = replicate.models.get("andreasjansson/clip-features")
outputs = model.predict(inputs=inputs)

# output similarity of the three text lines with the image on line 4
for i in range(3):
    print(outputs[i]["input"])
    print(cos_sim(outputs[i]["embedding"], outputs[3]["embedding"]))
    print()
```
